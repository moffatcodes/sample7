       <p>Having started this online course on December last year, Ih has not been the easiest of tasks. This course has taken me at least 7 months. We are currently in June, yeahs thats right, seven damn months. Moff, you are not serious.Assuming am in two different forms, I want to blame the me who has really contributed to this. Procastination, inconsistencies and not commiting myself. All in all, I thank God, I am almost through. To the rest of the online course I will take in this year, God I seek your halping hand and your able guidance.</p>
       <p> It is never that serious afterall, chill, remove your legs from the karai wth cold water. Have a listen to this banger.</p>
